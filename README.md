# google-workout-sheet

This program allows user to use natural language to add a workout, duration and estimated calories to a google sheet to keep track.

What is used:
- Sheety API (push to the google sheet)
- Google Sheets (store the data)
- Nutritionix API (used fot the natural language processing & get exercise information)

**Highlights:**
Working with APIs, it was nice to start using APIs with python. I had started to use them in javascript and it is nice to use the extra functionality of APIs. Learning to use .env with python was nice too because it feels more secure and it just is a fun to be able to do things like this.

**Struggles:**
Formatting the datetime information, it seem for the time part an extra ' kept getting added.
